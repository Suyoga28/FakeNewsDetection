# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting fake news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. It was developed and executed in a Jupyter Notebook environment using Python libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, and TfidfVectorizer.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Fake news has become a significant concern in the digital age. In this project, we:
- Load and clean a dataset of news headlines/articles.
- Preprocess the text using vectorization.
- Train a classification model to distinguish between real and fake news.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
